<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>There are many things we can spend our time with. One option is talking about ideas. For example, the 
the idea about the CBDSs is particularly interesting to me becuase it is concerning us all more than we
suspect.
</p>

<p>Another idea we can talk about is the crooked financial system and the total globak economic
  collapse that's headed towards us. As of today, 23rd October 2023 (Irinka's Birthday btw, gotta call her later),
  the situation around the world is slowly but gradually getting worse and worse. There are many conflicts
  around the world but the 2 major ones (because they are concerning the WEST) are NATO vs Russia,
  which is held on Ukranian territory with Ukranian soldiers on behalf of NATO (this one started
  24th February 2022) and Palestine vs Israel (which started officially 1948) but the latest episode of
  violence as of today started on the 7th of October 2023 with the Hamas Attack agains Israeli 
  citizens. So it's been 16 days now and the OFFICIAL numbers of the victims of boths sides is something like
  4700+ dead and 12 000 injured palestinians and 2400+ dead israelis + 240 israeli hostiges taken by Hamas.
</p>

<p>The last thing we could talk about is the technological advancement and the redundance of the human 
factor. Meaning why less and less people are needed for the humanity to continue to "prosper" and go
forward. Also, when people become redundant, what do you thing will happen to them? they will simply become
useless and by this they will be very easily put under the control of those who are in charge of all
technological advancements. People will be granted Basic Universal Incomes and be enslaved in some dark
blockchain base dictatory database.

  If you want to discuss why I think so and maybe offer some new perspectives on the way I am looking at 
  the world in general, please feel free to contact me :)
